[ilyagru.github.io](https://ilyagru.github.io)

Uses a custom Gatsby's blog starter. This starter ships with the main Gatsby configuration files you might need to get up and running.

## Quick start

1.  **Start developing**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing**

    The site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

1.  **Production**

    ```bash
    yarn build
    ```

1.  **Test locally**

    ```bash
    yarn serve
    ```

    The site is now running at `http://localhost:9000`!

1.  **Run tests**

    ```bash
    npm test
    ```

1.  **Deploy**

    ```bash
    yarn deploy
    ```

    For a repository named like ilyagru.github.io. Deploying automatically by Github Actions on merging to develop.

    Note: In this case you don't need to specify `--prefix-paths` and your website needs to be pushed to master branch.

Todos are tracked either with the comment or in the related GitHub project.
